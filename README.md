## Mycroft Tragedy of Darth Plagueis skill
Have you ever heard the Tragedy of Darth Plaguies the Wise? I thought not, its not a story the Jedi would tell.

## Description 
Recreate the Star Wars Revenge of the Sith scene where Palpatine explains the Tragedy of Darth Plaguies to Anakin.
You must start the skill by asking about "Darth Plaguies". After that you can navigate via any of Anakin's dialog 
in that scene and the app will respond as Palpatine.

## Usage 
See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/WyUibKkECNc) for the full dialog.

### Sample input phrases
* "Who was Darth Plagueis?"
* "He could actuall save people from death?"
* "What happened to him?"
* "Can this power be learned?"
